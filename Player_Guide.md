# Player Guide

## üéÆ How to Use the Leaderboard System

### Opening the Leaderboard

- **Custom Keybinds**: Some servers may configure different keys
- **Check Server Info**: Ask admins if K doesn't work
- **Close**: Press the same key again or click the red `X` button

### Understanding the Interface

#### **Main Display**
- **Leaderboard Title**: Shows current leaderboard name (e.g., "Zombie Kills")
- **Rankings**: Top 15 players with names, kills, and scores
- **Your Stats**: Your current kill count displayed at bottom

#### **Navigation Controls**
- **Left Arrow** (`<`): Previous leaderboard
- **Right Arrow** (`>`): Next leaderboard  
- **Close Button** (`X`): Close the interface

#### **Progress Tracking**
- **Last**: Your most recent reward threshold achieved

## üìä Understanding Rankings

### Scoring System
Different kills are worth different points:

#### **Zombie Kills**
- **Civilian Zombies**: 1 point each
- **Police/Military**: 3-4 points each
- **Special Forces**: 5-6 points each

#### **PVP Kills** 
- **Player Kills**: 10 points each (high value)

#### **Animal Hunting**
- **Small Animals**: 1-2 points (rabbits, chickens)
- **Medium Animals**: 3-5 points (deer, pigs)
- **Large Animals**: 8-20 points (bears, wolves)

### Ranking Determination
- **Primary**: Ranked by total **score** (not kill count)
- **Tie-breaker**: Higher kill count wins ties
- **Updates**: Rankings update every 30 seconds

## üéÅ Reward System

### How Rewards Work
1. **Reach threshold** (e.g., 10 kills)
2. **Green button appears** with "Claim Rewards"
3. **Click to claim** - items spawn in your inventory
4. **One-time only** - each threshold can only be claimed once

### Reward Examples

#### **Zombie Kill Rewards**
- **10 Kills**: Bandages + Ammunition
- **25 Kills**: Medical supplies + Ammo boxes
- **50 Kills**: Advanced gear + Weapons

#### **PVP Rewards**
- **3 Kills**: Combat ammunition + Medical
- **5 Kills**: Weapon attachments + Supplies  
- **10 Kills**: High-tier military gear

### Reward Tips
- **Check regularly** - claim as soon as available
- **Inventory space** - ensure you have room for items
- **Death resets** - some servers reset rewards on death

## üíÄ Death Penalties

### What Happens When You Die
Depends on server configuration:

#### **Score Penalties**
- **Typical**: Lose 25-50% of your score
- **Calculation**: New score = Old score √ó (1 - penalty)
- **Example**: 100 score ‚Üí 75 score (25% penalty)

#### **Kill Count Reset**
- **Some servers**: Reset kill count to 0 on death
- **Others**: Preserve kill count through deaths
- **Check**: Test on your server to understand behavior

#### **Reward Reset**
- **Common**: Unclaimed rewards reset on death
- **Means**: Must re-earn the right to claim rewards
- **Claimed rewards**: Already collected items are safe

### Death Penalty Examples

#### **Zombie Leaderboard** (Typical)
- **Death Penalty**: 50% score loss
- **Kills Reset**: Yes (back to 0)
- **Rewards Reset**: No (keep claimed items)

#### **PVP Leaderboard** (Competitive)
- **Death Penalty**: 25% score loss (less harsh)
- **Kills Reset**: Yes (prevents exploits)
- **Rewards Reset**: Yes (maintains risk/reward)

## üèÜ Multiple Leaderboards

### Types of Leaderboards
Most servers run multiple leaderboards:

1. **Zombie Kills** - Infected elimination
2. **PVP Kills** - Player vs Player combat
3. **Animal Hunting** - Wildlife tracking
4. **Custom** - Server-specific challenges

### Switching Between Leaderboards
- Use **arrow buttons** in the UI
- Each leaderboard tracks **separate progress**
- **Independent rewards** for each category

## üí° Tips for Success

### Maximizing Score
- **Target high-value enemies** (military zombies, players)
- **Avoid unnecessary deaths** (preserve your score)
- **Claim rewards promptly** (before potential death)

### Strategic Play
- **Know the values** - learn which kills give most points
- **Risk vs Reward** - weigh high-value targets against danger
- **Survival first** - dead players can't earn points

### Server-Specific Notes
- **Check server rules** - some servers have custom configurations
- **Ask other players** - learn about specific server behaviors
- **Test safely** - understand penalty system before risky plays

## üîß Customization

### Keybind Changes
If you want to change the leaderboard keybind:
1. **Contact server admin** - keybinds are server-controlled
2. **Standard key**: Usually `K` by default
3. **No client changes** - modification requires server update

### Display Preferences
The leaderboard system uses server-side settings:
- **Cannot change** ranking displays
- **Cannot modify** reward thresholds  
- **Cannot adjust** scoring values
